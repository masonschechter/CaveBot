### RoleBot
Current command prefix: $

RoleBot was designed to bring order to a community Discord server that I established. It's main functionality is to enable members of the server to
self-assign and self-remove roles. The roles correspond to common games played and are represented by their respective game icons. If someone were 
looking for a partner in Fortnite, for example, they could "@Fortnite" and only Fortnite players would be pinged.

RoleBot also includes some silly functions:

$mock "username":
	Finds the last thing said by "username" and returns it with AlTeRnAtInG cApiTaLiZaTiOn

$eightball "yes_or_no_question":
	Returns custom eightball responses to yes or no questions



*Curently working on implementing Blackjack, from /home-projects/Games/, in RoleBot. The goal is to have a local database that permanently keeps track 
of user's chip counts during and between games*
